Find open-source solutions for $ARGUMENTS. Don't build what already exists. Ask clarifying questions if language, license, or integration constraints are unclear.

For each option: repo URL, what it does, stars/downloads, last commit date (from repo, not registry), contributor count, license, fit assessment. Verify maintenance — flag if last commit >1 year, single contributor, or issues go unanswered. Include build-vs-use analysis with recommendation.

Save to `artifacts/research/YYYY-MM-DD-[topic]-open-source.md` (create dir if needed). Include sources.
