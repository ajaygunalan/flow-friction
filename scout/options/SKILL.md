Compare options for $ARGUMENTS. Structured side-by-side comparison for an informed decision. Ask clarifying questions if criteria, options, or deal-breakers are unclear.

Define weighted criteria. Evaluate each option against each criterion. Present comparison matrix. Recommend one with reasoning. Include runner-up with conditions where it becomes the better choice.

Save to `artifacts/research/YYYY-MM-DD-[topic]-options.md` (create dir if needed). Include sources.
