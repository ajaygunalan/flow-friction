Assess feasibility of $ARGUMENTS. Honest reality check — can we actually build this? Ask clarifying questions if constraints or risk tolerance are unclear.

Evaluate three dimensions: technical (can we build it?), resource (do we have what we need?), external dependencies (are they reliable?). Identify blockers with severity and mitigation. End with a clear verdict: Go / Go with conditions / No-go.

Save to `artifacts/research/YYYY-MM-DD-[topic]-feasibility.md` (create dir if needed). Include sources.
