description: Research how to implement something - approaches, libraries, tradeoffs
argument-hint: [what to implement or leave blank for current context]
---

Research implementation approaches for $ARGUMENTS. Find 2-4 viable ways to build it — libraries, patterns, architectures — with honest tradeoffs. Ask clarifying questions if constraints or priorities are unclear.

For each approach: how it works, specific libraries/tools, complexity (S/M/L), pros, cons, best-when. Compare in a matrix. Recommend one based on stated constraints.
