Research historical attempts at $ARGUMENTS. Find what's been tried — industry, academic, internal — and extract lessons. Ask clarifying questions if scope or timeframe is unclear.

For each attempt: what they tried, what worked, what failed and why. Identify common success factors, common failure modes, what's different now. End with concrete do/don't lessons.

Save to `artifacts/research/YYYY-MM-DD-[topic]-history.md` (create dir if needed). Include sources.
