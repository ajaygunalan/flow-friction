Research competitive landscape for $ARGUMENTS. Identify 3-5 competitors (direct and indirect). Ask clarifying questions if dimensions or goals are unclear.

For each competitor: how they solve it, target audience, strengths, weaknesses, pricing. Identify patterns across all, gaps/opportunities, and differentiation options.

Save to `artifacts/research/YYYY-MM-DD-[topic]-competitive.md` (create dir if needed). Include sources.
