Investigate $ARGUMENTS. Route to scout methodology: technical (how to build), open-source (libraries/tools), feasibility (can we?), deep-dive (thorough understanding), competitive (how others solve it), landscape (map the space), history (what's been tried), options (compare choices).

**Narrow topic** → one scout via Task tool.

**Broad topic** → spawn an agent team. Each scout is a teammate with its own methodology. Scouts message each other to challenge findings and resolve contradictions. Synthesize after debate converges.

Save to `docs/RESEARCH.md`. Include Original Intent (what user asked) and Evolved Understanding (what we now know) as bookends.
