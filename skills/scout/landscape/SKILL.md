Map the landscape of $ARGUMENTS. Understand the full space — players, tools, trends, gaps. Ask clarifying questions if scope or focus is unclear.

Organize into categories. For each: established players, emerging players, key tools, trend direction. Identify gaps/white space and strategic implications.

Save to `artifacts/research/YYYY-MM-DD-[topic]-landscape.md` (create dir if needed). Include sources.
